  This is by far my biggest project so far, the idea was to create a responsive portfolio that includes dynamically rendered pages using react, react-router-dom etc. So far I have created a responsive layout for desktop and mobile and routed the different pages. I'm very happy with what I have so far and cannot wait to complete this project as there are so many different outcomes. I look forward to using React in the future and expanding my knowledge.
